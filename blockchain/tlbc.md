The Trustlines Blockchain (TLBC) was sunset in December 2022 and the Trustlines Protocol
have been deployed on [0x77dd8aae9230B11C65FEb571c5882F7502beA5C

## Why was TLBC sunset?
When we started the Trustlines project in 2018, we were looking for a blockchain that would
be a good fit for our use case. We wanted a blockchain that would be fast, cheap and
decentralized. Unfortunately back at that time there was no blockchain that would fulfill
our requirements. We therefore decided to launch our own. 

Fast-forward to 2022, now we have Gnosis Chain, that offers cheap and fast transactions and is fully decentralized.
So it no longer made sense for the Trustlines project to maintain the Trustlines Blockchain.
